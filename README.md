## **Introduction to Research**\[1\]

This interdisciplinary research study cell-surface N-glycoproteins through LC-MS based shotgun proteomic tools, an important factor in stem-cell development. The stem-cell behavior is influenced by extra-cellular microenvironment through these proteins and this study attempts to understand the phenomena.

LC-MS based shotgun proteomics uses HPLC that deliver 1 nanoliter/minute constant flow. It operates under intensive atmosphere pressure \(100-1000 C\) for high resolution separation. Following this, it takes mere few minutes to derive million peptides from thousand protein through mass spectrometry analysis. It detects and quantifies entire proteome of all biological samples and helps with systematic study of human health and diseases.

## **Repository Overview**

Pertaining to the current research comprising the subset of overall research objectives, this repository contains the raw data for analysis. It also contains the relevant files and programs required to obtain the mouse’s final loop stat output. This discourse took immense research to determine the suitable programming language, file-format and tools for data analysis. Following the successful acquisition of results, it’s important to ensure the final results reliability and overall accuracy. For the same reason, all programming scripts incorporate embedded test cases with unit tests.

The scope of intended explanation leaves the technical aspects entailing the research and discuss information relevant to obtain stastical results using programming tools.
